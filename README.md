<h1 align="center">ZType Word Game</h1>

<p>Welcome to ZType, a fast-paced typing game where your goal is to destroy words by typing them before they reach the bottom of the screen. Simply run the program to start the game. As words appear at the top and descend, quickly type them using your keyboard, ensuring accuracy and pressing Enter to submit. Destroyed words earn you points, but if any word reaches the bottom untouched, the game ends. Additional features include scorekeeping, multiple levels, a restart option, variable word lengths for added challenge, and enhanced graphics. Controls are straightforwardâ€”type words and press Enter. The game generates random words for each session but offers predictable randomness for testing, ensuring consistent results. Enjoy the game, have fun, and aim for a high score!</p>
